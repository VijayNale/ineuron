It calculates the probability that a given value belongs to a specific class. If the probability is more than 50%, it assigns the value in that particular class else if the probability is less than 50%, the value is assigned to the other class. Therefore, we can say that logistic regression acts as a binary classifier."

Why? but for now I’ll simply say it’s because our prediction function is non-linear (due to sigmoid transform). Squaring this prediction as we do in MSE results in a non-convex function with many local minimums. If our cost function has many local minimums, gradient descent may not find the optimal global minimum.\n",

The logic is simple; we train our logistic model for each class and calculate the probability(hθx) that a specific feature belongs to that class. Once we have trained the model for all the classes, we predict a new value’s class by choosing that class for which the probability(hθx) is maximum. Although we have libraries that we can use to perform multinomial logistic regression, we rarely use logistic regression for classification problems where the number of classes is more than 2"

Positive classes are indicated with 1 and negative classes with 0 or -1. It is thus comparable to running n_classes binary classification tasks For example, prediction of the topics relevant to a text document or video.
